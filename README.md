## NORA in Action


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe0384d9-b2eb-4ab0-b65a-a285ceb4b349


We are releasing some of the videos recorded during experiments showing how NORA performs real-world tasks with the WidowX robot -- [WidowX Demos](https://declare-lab.github.io/nora#demos).

## Checkpoints
[Model weights on Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/collections/declare-lab/nora-6811ba3e820ef362d9eca281)
## Getting Started For Inference
We provide a lightweight interface with minimal dependencies to get started with loading and running Nora for inference.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/declare-lab/nora.git
cd inference
# Create and activate conda environment
conda create -n nora python=3.10 -y
conda activate nora
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For example, to load Nora for zero-shot instruction following in the BridgeData V2 environments with a WidowX robot:
```python

# Load VLA
from inference.nora import Nora
nora = Nora(device='cuda')

# Get Inputs
image: Image.Image = camera(...)
instruction: str = <INSTRUCTION>
# Predict Action (7-DoF; un-normalize for BridgeData V2)
actions = nora.inference(
    image=image,  # Dummy image
    instruction=instruction,
    unnorm_key='bridge_orig'  # Optional, specify if needed
)
# Execute...
robot.act(action, ...)
```

## How to Pretrain Nora/ Finetune nora
```bash
git clone https://github.com/declare-lab/nora.git
cd training
# Create and activate conda environment
conda create -n nora_train python=3.10 -y
conda activate nora_train
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Our repository make use of huggingface's accelerate library for package from Hugging Face for multi-GPU training. Set up your own accelerator config base on your cluster's configuration. Model hyperparameters/settings are stored in the TrainingConfig in train.py. 
To download the dataset for training, you can refer to [Open X-Embodiment (OXE) mixture](https://robotics-transformer-x.github.io/) for details. Our dataset structure uses the same RLDS format used by [OpenVLA](https://github.com/openvla/openvla) training. You can also check OpenVLA's github for more information .
Once you have set the correct data path etcs, you can simply train nora with the following command!
```bash
accelerate launch train.py --config_file='your_accelerator_accelerate_config.yaml'
```
## ⚠️ Finetune with Action Chunking (Important)
To finetune NORA-LONG/NORA with different action horizon length, you will have to modify the future action window size as shown below https://github.com/declare-lab/nora/blob/5ad1658aa41c87e4cbb2f9da3f73b62840070280/training/datasets/datasets.py#L132. 

## Evaluating Nora on WidowX BridgeV2
We use OpenVLA's codebase to peform evaluation on Widow X BridgeV2. Please check OpenVLA's github repository on instructions how to set up WidowX robot server for BridgeData V2  evaluations. 
[https://github.com/openvla/openvla/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#evaluating-openvla](https://github.com/openvla/openvla/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#bridgedata-v2-widowx-evaluations)

After setting up the Widow X's robot server, you can open another terminal window to run the Nora policy evaluation script:
```python
cd experiments/bridge/
python run_widowx.py
```
